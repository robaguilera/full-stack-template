## Overview

This repo sets up a full stack development environment. You have a server running Node/Express and React client. The server uses a simple set of scripts to run while React is built using Vite.

## Instructions

1. Using your package manager of choice (yarn, npm, pnpm, etc) run an install (e.g. yarn install) in each folder (root, server, client)
2. From the root run `yarn dev` and this will concurrently spin up your server and client for development
3. From the root run `yarn build` and this will concurrently build both your server and client code for development
